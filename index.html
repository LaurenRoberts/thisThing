    <p>Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We'll do another happy little painting. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.
</p>
<p>A little happy sunlight shining through there. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. We'll have a super time. You can get away with a lot. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.
</p>
<p>This painting comes right out of your heart. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.</p>
<p>Have fun with it. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Every day I learn.
</p>
<p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. We'll make some happy little bushes here. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
</p>
<p>This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. A fan brush can be your best friend. Learn when to stop.
</p>
<p>The least little bit can do so much. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. At home you have unlimited time.
